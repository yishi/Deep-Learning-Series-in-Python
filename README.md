[Deep Learning Series 2: Classifying MNIST digits using Multi-Layer Perceptron](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/Deep-Learning-Series-in-Python/blob/master/deep_learning_series_2.ipynb)

**Summary:**
Classifying MNIST digits get best test error 1.65% by using Multi-Layer Perceptron, but training the model spend nearly six hours in my laptop on CPU.
In my exercise, classifying MNIST digits using Logistic Regression, have best test error 7.5%, but training the model only spend 20.4 second in the same computer on CPU.
**Tiny improve in test error, need more capacity or knoweledge and time.**
> No free lunch.
